# Biplots-of-point-patterns
This repo accompanies the manuscript "Near enough is good enough - Inferring co-occurrence from biplots of multivariate point patterns" submitted to the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
The code can be used to replicate both the simulations and real data analyses therein.

## Lansing Woods
Contains code to analyze the Lansing Woods dataset from the spatstat package on R. Including model selection, fitting, and constructing the biplot.

## Northern NSW
Conatains code to analyze the northern New South Wales dataset from the disdat package on R. Includes methods of model selection, fitting, and construction of the biplot.

## Simulations
Contains code for simulations to investigate a data-driven strategy for choosing the number of basis functions used within the multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process underpinning biplots.
